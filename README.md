## UI Library Options

### shadcn/ui
Modern, accessible component system built on Radix UI primitives. Components are copy-pasted into your codebase for full control.

### Chakra UI
Popular React component library focused on simplicity, modularity, and accessibility.

### Material UI (MUI)
React implementation of Google's Material Design system with comprehensive components.

### DaisyUI
Tailwind CSS component library providing semantic class names for rapid development.

### Flowbite
Component library built on Tailwind CSS with React bindings.

## Application Types

### SPA (Single Page Application)
- Built with **Vite** for fast development and builds
- Client-side routing with React Router
- Optimized for modern browsers
- Best for web applications and dashboards

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- Built with **Next.js** for SEO and performance
- File-based routing system
- API routes support
- Static site generation capabilities
- Best for marketing sites and blogs

## State Management Options

### None (React State Only)
Uses React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer, Context API).

### Redux Toolkit
Modern Redux with simplified API, built-in best practices, and TypeScript support.

### Zustand
Lightweight state management with minimal boilerplate and great TypeScript integration.

## After Generation

1. **Navigate to your project**:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   # For SPA projects
   npm run dev
   
   # For SSR projects  
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   # Unit tests
   npm run test
   
   # E2E tests
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

5. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Docker Development (if enabled)

```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up

# Build production image
docker build -t your-project:latest .

# Run production container
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-project:latest
```

## Claude Code Integration

This template includes CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files that provide:

- Project-specific coding guidelines
- Development workflow instructions
- Common commands and patterns
- Architecture overview
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD pipeline information

These files help Claude Code understand your project structure and provide more accurate assistance.
